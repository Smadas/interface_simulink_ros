# interface_simulink_ros
An example simulink code how to interface data between Matlab Simulink Stateflow and ROS.
The example schematic shows how to receive a message from ROS master and how to send a message to ROS master.
There is also example stateflow schematic as a simple control algorithm for simulated iRobot Create to avoid obstacles.

You can use it with aditional packages:
To generate a maze
Smadas/maze_generator_ros
To create a control algorithm
Smadas/create_control_ros

For aditional information how to create interface between ROS and Matlab Simulink see the tutorial documents.
